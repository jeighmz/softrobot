# R2D2

Welcome to the R2D2 directory! This directory contains the necessary files and scripts to simulate and control the R2D2 robot using PyBullet.

## User Controllable Script

The `sim-key-control.py` script allows users to control the R2D2 robot in the simulation environment. This script provides an interactive interface for controlling the robot's movements and actions.

## EA

This directory also includes several EA (Evolutionary Algorithm) directories. These directories contain the code and resources related to the evolutionary algorithms used for optimizing the behavior and performance of the R2D2 robot.

Please refer to the specific EA directories, such as `analysis` and `evolutionary_algorithm`, for more information on the algorithms, configurations, and results. Additionally, you can find detailed specifications such as joint_count and limitations for the robot in the `specs` directory.
